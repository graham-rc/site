On 21st June 2024, I set off hoping to run/hike the "Walkers Haute Route". It didn't exactly go to plan. Days one and two went without any real issue, but I was finding snow at around 2500m. The route crosses the grain of the Swiss mountains, with 7 passes close to 3000m and a significant time above 2500m. There are no real alternatives as the valley routes would be huge detours.
