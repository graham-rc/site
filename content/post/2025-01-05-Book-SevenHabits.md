## NOTE: At time of writing I have only read a small amount of the book, I intend to write a little as I read each section, really for my own reference.

A colleague, who I respect and who has become a friend, recommended this book – not directly to me but I was heard him recommend it. Shortly after, I saw someone reading it on a flight to Copenhagen. I have a natural aversion to anything “aspirational” within the realm of business and self improvement. I remember people at university who had pictures of Lamborghinis as their desktop background on their laptop, I feel uncomfortable around people who want to succeed at any cost, and who measure that success in status symbols and wealth, I don’t believe this to be a sustainable, compassionate or fulfilling way to live life. Of course it doesn't hurt to become wealthy, I'm not saying we should all strive to be extremely poor and just be happy about it.

I had heard of this book and put it in my mind as a book for those types of people, who will always think they need more things and will never be truly happy. When my friend mentioned the book again, because I respect his opinion, I admitted my prejudice and explained how I judged the person reading it on the flight. 

He did know what I was getting, which was a relief because I was opening up about being a judgmental prick, he explained that there is nothing in the book that expects you to trample on others for your own success or anything toxic like that. Instead it’s full of working on your compassion and understanding to be less judgmental of others, plus generally useful and actionable advice to work well with people in business and personal life. Kindly and compassionately shitting all over my judgement!

Maybe I _should_ give it a read.
